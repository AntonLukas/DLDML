# DLDML
The convolutional neural network designed for drawdown log-derivative analysis as described in: Machine learning applied to aquifer test analysis: Drawdown log-derivative classification with convolutional neural networks

DLDML is primarily focussed at identifying discrete near-horizontal fracture flow in drawdown log-derivative plots.
